# Streaming-EDA
This is a group project I worked on over the summer as a part of STOR 320 at UNC. Our goal was to take data we found on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney) and use it to find comparisons and differences between the films in the data set and which streaming services they were available on.
